# task-price-service
Your task is to create an Aggregated Price Service for crypto tokens. The service’s goal is to  report token prices (in USD) at a specific date time, given (1) token symbol (e.g. ETH, USDC),  and (2) the unix time you want to query the price at. The service should be able to query  historical data for up to 7 days.
